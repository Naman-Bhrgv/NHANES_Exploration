## NHANES Data Exploration

This project is designed with the goal of achieving a deeper understanding of two significant
health-related queries using NHANES data.
Question 1 - addresses the multitude of elements that may affect variations in body weight
among a certain group of people. To tackle this, we aim to rigorously examine and forecast
the Body Mass Index (BMI) as it relates to various predictive factors.


Question 2 - pivots to the area of dietary habits and their correlation to hypertension. We
seek to unravel the connection between the choices individuals make regarding their food
intake and the onset or exacerbation of hypertension.
